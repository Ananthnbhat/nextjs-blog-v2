## What is a react element?

It is the description of the markup we want to create and show it to the user on a browser.

For example, below is a paragraph react element.

```jsx
const element = React.createElement(
  'p',
  {
    id: 'hello',
  },
  'Hello World!'
)
```

## Most basic structure of react js app.

```jsx
// index.js
import React from 'react'
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'

//// Old way:
// const element = React.createElement(
//   'p',
//   {
//     id: 'hello',
//   },
//   'Hello World!'
// );

// New way:
const element = <p id="hello">Hello World!</p>

const container = document.querySelector('#root')
const root = createRoot(container)
root.render(element)
```

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

1. We import the core library, `React`, and the web specific library `react-dom`. (there are other platform libraries such as `react-native`)
2. The old way to creating a react element is shows us the syntax of a react element:
   - the type of react element.
   - properties being set to this element.
   - content of this element - this could be another react element, which created a tree of elements.
     The react element actually is a javascript object which looks like this:

```js
{
  type: "p",
  key: null,
  ref: null,
  props: {
    id: 'hello',
    children: 'Hello World!',
  },
  _owner: null,
  _store: { validated: false }
}
```

The new way of creating a react element is via `jsx` syntax, which gets transpiled (converting 1 high level language to another high level language) to javascript.
This is because jsx is the easier & faster alternative to create react elements compared to the pure javascript method.

3. Finally, we render the application:
   - get the div with root selector.
   - declare that this is the root of the application.
   - render (insert or append) our react element inside the root: convert react elements to DOM nodes. This means, the Javascript description
     of the HTML element (a react element) gets converted to a DOM node.

### What is a DOM (Document Object Model)

DOM is what gets shown to the user when they visit a website. Its what the browser understands about how to show a website.
A react app gets finally converted to HTML and the HTML turns into DOM in the browser. DOM is a document with a structure of a tree.
Each branch of the tree ends with a node. Each node has JS objects which can be programmatically accessed to change its content, style or interactivity by attaching event handlers to them.

React interacts with the DOM via javascript. The conversion flow is as below:

> react (jsx) elements -> transpiled to javascript -> creates/appends HTML elements -> converted to DOM nodes in the browser.

## Compile time vs run time

Compile time is the code processing that happens during compilation. For example, the react code (jsx) getting converted to JS is called transpilation (generally called compilation).
The processing that happens when the react code gets rendered and some function runs, is called run time - it is the code execution that happens in the browser when the application runs.

## What is a react component?

Everything in an react app is a component. A component is a bundle of text, styles, interactivity which make up a specific part of UI content for a user.

## What is a react fragment?

It is a react component used to group elements together that doesn't produce a DOM node.

```jsx
<>
  <OneChild />
  <AnotherChild />
</>
```

## Control flow operator (&&)

This is also called as short-circuit operator, used as an alternative to if-else statement in jsx. What we need to make sure while using this kind of `expression` is that the left side
of the `&&` always gets evaluated to a boolean value.

For example, both of the below examples do the same

```jsx
// with &&
function Friend({ name, isOnline }) {
  return (
    <li className="friend">
      {isOnline && <div className="green-dot" />}
      {name}
    </li>
  )
}
```

```jsx
// without &&
function Friend({ name, isOnline }) {
  let prefix
  if (isOnline) {
    prefix = <div className="green-dot" />
  } else {
    // in this case prefix is false, so nothing gets rendered.
    prefix = isOnline
  }

  return (
    <li className="friend">
      {prefix}
      {name}
    </li>
  )
}
```

## Visibility toggling

If we want to toggle the visibility of an element, we could use 2 approaches:

1. Conditional rendering: this method only creates & inserts DOM node if condition evaluates to true. So, there is less memory consumption as not every DOM node is created. But
   if the condition evaluates to true, then the DOM node needs to be created every time.
2. CSS property: this method hides the element using CSS. So, every DOM node gets created during rendering, so there is higher memory consumption comparatively. But this
   makes the process of toggling faster as there is no need to create DOM node every time its toggled.

## Reconciliation

React takes a snapshot every time it renders. During next render it compares the elements with the previous render (snapshot) to see what has changed and it updates the only the changed DOM elements.
This way the whole DOM is not re-created.

## Rendering vs Painting

Rendering is how React figures out what has changed between new snapshot and the old one.Re-render happens during Reconciliation process where it finds the differences and edits the real DOM. Re-painting is where it takes the changed DOM elements and paints it on the browser for the user.
Not all re-renders require re-painting. If nothing has changed between snapshots then there is no need of re-painting.

## What triggers re-rendering?

Only a state change can trigger a re-rendering in the component where the state has changed + its descendants. It's possible to
prevent re-rendering of a descendant component, if its unnecessary, by making it [**Pure**](./performance-optimizations#memo) using `React.memo(XyzComponent)`.
This is one of the performance improvement techniques called `Memoization` of component.

## Synthetic events in React

When an react element is bound to an event handler, it propagates the event to the handler. This event is not the standard event of Javascript. React maps its own event object
to the Javascript events while fixing some of the browser inconsistencies & including additional features. The real JS event can be accessed using `event.nativeEvent`.

More on this from React docs: https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/common#react-event-object.

## What is a variable?

A label is assigned to data saved in memory - variable.

- `const`- the label pointing to the data is locked.
- `let` - label can be pointed to different data in memory (re-assignment)

For `const`, although its link to data is locked, the data itself can be modified (mutation) as long as the data is non-primitive.

primitive data types - boolean, string, number, bigint, undefined, symbol, null.

non primitive data types - objects (function), array.

## truthy & falsy values

Falsy values in JS:

- false
- null
- undefined
- '' (empty string)
- 0 (or 0.0, -0)
- NaN

Everything else is truthy.

## Dynamic key generation

When we render a list of something, each item in the list is expected to have unique key. React uses these keys to keep track of each items of the list. This unique key can't be the index of the item as
the index may change if the list is modified. Its not a good idea of use `Math.random()` as the key value because if you add a new item to the list, which re-renders the page assigning new key values to each item by running
`Math.random()`. So, the better way is to inject the key value as either `Math.random()` or `crypto.randomUUID()` to the item object when it gets created rather than when it gets rendered.

## Why you should not mutate non-primitives during state updates?

When you set state in react, it will re-render only if the value has changed? No, react compares the current value & previous value using referential equality (think about const image).
If the value has same reference, it won't re-render. If it has new reference it will re-render.

Primitive values are immutable, so when you set state, the state has a new value with new reference, so there is a re-render. Whereas non-primitive values are mutable, so when you set state, it doesn't change the reference.
So, the value should not be mutated, instead set a new value to the state. This way a new reference gets created for that state value and re-render occurs.

For an array:

- create a new array.
- insert the old one into the new one.
- modify the new array as required for the state change.
- set this new array as new state (update the state using the new array).

## Why should we wrap a form inside a `<form>` tag?

Otherwise, we cant listen to onSubmit events. A user may click Enter key instead of clicking the submit button using a mouse. The `form` tag automatically listens to the form submissions which may be done by either clicking the button
or pressing the enter key in the keyboard.

We need to prevent default behavior of the form submissions when `onSubmit` event is triggered. This is because the form tries to redirect the user to a new URL specified in the action attribute. If the attribute is not set,
it'll reload the page. To stop this from happening, we stop the default behavior because when a form is submitted, we want to either make an API call or change some state. So, we use `event.preventDefault()` inside the
`onSubmit` event handler.

## Component & component instances

A component is a re-usable UI element. For example, we may build a button component that can be used in multiple scenarios throughout an application. Each time a new component is created/used, its called as a component instance and a
long running object gets created storing contextual information about it.

## State updates are asynchronous.

Each state updates are asynchronous. If multiple state updates are there, each get batched and gets executed asynchronously. This is done to reduce the load on the system, which could render multiple times each time a state gets
updated. There may be situations where we need other states to be updated along with current one or there are dependent state updates. For all these situations, asynchronous state updates come in handy.
