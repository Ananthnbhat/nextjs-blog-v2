## What is a react hook?

A react hook is a reusable javascript function or method with special rules associated with it.

- Hook name should start with `use`.
- A hook should be called at the top level of the component or the function.
- A hook must be called inside a function component, not a class component.

There are react provided hooks and custom hooks that a dev can implement. A custom hook can call other hooks.

Some of the most commonly used React provided hooks are,

- `useState`: holds & tracks state for the component.
- `useReducer`: holds multiple states and provides feature to update them using reducer functions.
- `useEffect`: can perform side effects such as state changes, API calls and more.
- `useMemo`: for performance improvement: can cache the output of a function or a expensive computation.
- `useCallback`: for performance improvement: can cache the definition of a function - skips re-rendering of the function.
- [`useContext`](./react-component#context): for global state management: can pass data from distant component/parent to a leaf node/component.
- `useRef`: mostly used to hold a DOM node and perform actions on it. Preserves the value between re-renders.
