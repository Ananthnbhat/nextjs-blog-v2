## Prop delegation

When we need to pass multiple props through multiple component or children, we can use the spread operator to pass them on instead of passing them individually.
For example,

```jsx
function LoggedInBanner({
  user,
  // all unspecified props:
  ...delegated
}) {
  if (!user || user.registrationStatus === 'unverified') {
    return null
  }

  // And pass them onto Banner:
  return <Banner {...delegated} />
}
```

Similarly, below 3 code snippets are same

```jsx
// This code:
<Banner {...delegated} />

// ...is same as:
<Banner type={delegated.type} children={delegated.children} />


// ...which is the same as:
<Banner type={delegated.type}>{delegated.children}</Banner>
```

> We have to remember that this delegated prop should be last prop as we cannot add comma after it

This delegation technique also helps whoever is using the component to provide additional props which are not necessarily defined by the original developer. For example,

```jsx
function Checkbox({ label, ...delegated }) {
  const id = React.useId()

  return (
    <>
      <label htmlFor={id}>{label}</label>
      <input id={id} type="checkbox" {...delegated} />
    </>
  )
}
```

But an interesting situation with above component is that it can be used like below, which overrides the main use of the input component as a checkbox, leading to bugs

```jsx
<Checkbox label="Do you agree to the terms?" type="button" onClick={handleAgreeToTerms} />
```

So, we can avoid this situation by enforcing some props as non-overridable like so,

```jsx
function Checkbox({ label, ...delegated }) {
  const id = React.useId()

  return (
    <>
      <label htmlFor={id}>{label}</label>
      <input {...delegated} id={id} type="checkbox" />
    </>
  )
}
```

So, based on the component a decision needs to be made to how much control do we give the user of the component to override,

- If we want the component to be overridable, place `{...delegated}` as the last prop.
- If we want the component NOT to be overridable, place `{...delegated}` as the first prop.

This concept can be applied to styling component,

1. If we want the component's style to be overridable, let `className` to be overridden.

```jsx
// sliderClassName can be a prop accepted by the component which allows className to be custom one.
<input {...delegated} type="range" id={id} className={sliderClassName || defaultStyling} />
```

2. If we want the component NOT to be overridable, specify which styling properties can be overridden.

```jsx
<input
  {...delegated}
  type="range"
  id={id}
  className={styles.slider}
  style={{
    '--handle-size': handleSize,
    '--handle-color': handleColor,
    '--handle-active-color': handleActiveColor,
  }}
/>
```

## Using ref

From React 19, we can use the `ref` property to pass the reference of a DOM node from child component to the parent component.

### What is `ref` and `useRef`?

The `useRef` hooks is used to hold a value that is not used for any UI rendering. So, if there is a re-render,
the value stored using the useRef remains the same and is not re-rendered.

```jsx:useRefExample.jsx
// initial value of ref is 0
const ref = React.useRef(1)

// current value of the ref can be re-assigned and this doesn't trigger a re-render
ref.current = ref.current + 1

console.log(ref.current) // prints 2
```

`ref` property can be used along with `useRef` React hook to access and action on a DOM node.

```jsx:refExample.jsx
// 1. initialize a ref with null value
const myRef = useRef(null);

// 3. use the ref to bring focus to the input on component mount
useEffect(() => {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  }, [])

// 2. assign myRef to a ref property of a node.
<input type="text" value="input value" ref={myRef} />
```

### Forwarding ref

```jsx:refForwardingExample.jsx
import { useRef } from 'react';
const ParentComponent = () => {

  // 1. create ref here
  const inputRef = useRef(null)

  const handleClick = () => {
    // 4. this will focus the input in the child component
    inputRef.current.focus()
  }


  return(
    // 2. Pass it to a child component
    <>
      <ChildInputComponent refToPass={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Focus input</button>
    </>

  )

  const ChildInputComponent = ({ refToPass }) => {
    return(
      // 3. assign ref to a built in component like <input />
      <input type="text" ref={refToPass} >
    )
  }
}
```

## Polymorphism in React

When we need to dynamically use an html tag based on the condition, then this technique is helpful.

```js:App.js
import React from 'react';

import List from './List'

function App() {
  return (
    <main>
      <List>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
      </List>
      <List as="ol">
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
      </List>
    </main>
  );
}

export default App;
```

```js:List.js
import React from 'react';

import styles from './List.module.css';

const VALID_TAGS = ['ul', 'ol'];

function List({
  // ol | ul
  as: Tag = 'ul',
  className = '',
  children,
  ...delegated
}) {
  if (!VALID_TAGS.includes(Tag)) {
    throw new Error(
      `Unrecognized tag: ${Tag}. Expected: ${VALID_TAGS}`
    );
  }

  return (
    <Tag
      {...delegated}
      className={`${styles.wrapper} ${className}`}
    >
      {children}
    </Tag>
  );
}

export default List;
```

The above example is taken from [joyofreact.com](https://joyofreact.com) course as it helps explain the concept perfectly.
In this example, we make the `List` component dynamic by assigning the `Tag` component either `ul` or `ol` based on the `as` parameter. This is broadly usable if there are more than 2
possible valid tags for Tag component.

Another simpler alternative would be,

```js:List.js
function List({
  ordered,
  className = '',
  children,
  ...delegated
}) {
  // only 1 out of 2 value for Tag in this example.
  const Tag = ordered ? 'ol' : 'ul'

  return (
    <Tag
      {...delegated}
      className={`${styles.wrapper} ${className}`}
    >
      {children}
    </Tag>
  );
}
```

In the above example, we just use a ternary operator to determine what `Tag` should be based on whether ordered is passed in as true or false.

This works because the Tag component results in a string, i.e., from above example, it will be either 'ul' or 'ol'. And this is how a [react element]('./react-basics#what-is-a-react-element') understands about what needs to be rendered.

```jsx:example.jsx
// This code:
React.createElement(
  Tag,
  {
    href,
    className: styles.button,
    ...delegated
  },
  children
);

// Is the same as this code:
<Tag
  href={href}
  className={styles.button}
  {...delegated}
>
  {children}
</Tag>
```

In the above code, the Tag gets converted to 'ul' or 'ol',

```jsx:example.jsx
React.createElement(
  'ol',
  {
    href,
    className: styles.button,
    ...delegated
  },
  children
);

```

> This method can be used when the Tag component results in a HTML tag such as a,p,span etc., not a React component.

## Compound components

Compound components is where multiple components are combined together because they are dependent on each
other while sharing logic and state. One of the primitive examples of this pattern is the `<select />` tag which is used together
with the `<option />` tag.

In React, many libraries and frameworks use this pattern to reduce imports in a component. For example,

```jsx
// Example from React Bootstrap
import Dropdown from 'react-bootstrap/Dropdown'

function UserButton() {
  return (
    <Dropdown>
      <Dropdown.Toggle>Actions</Dropdown.Toggle>

      <Dropdown.Menu>
        <Dropdown.Item href="/change-email">Change Email</Dropdown.Item>
        <Dropdown.Item href="/reset-pwd">Reset Password</Dropdown.Item>
        <Dropdown.Item href="/delete">Delete account</Dropdown.Item>
      </Dropdown.Menu>
    </Dropdown>
  )
}
```

This works because like everything in javascript, functions are also objects. So, functions can have properties, for example,

```jsx
function someFunc(a, b) {
  return a + b
}
someFunc.label = 'someFunc has label property'
console.log(someFunc.label) // "someFunc has label property"
```

Similarly, from the 1st example of `<Dropdown />`, gets property called Toggle (& Menu and Item) assigned to it as shown below,

```js:Dropdown.js
function Dropdown({children}){
  return <>{children}</>
}
function DropdownToggle({ children }) {
  return (
    <button>{children}</button>
  );
}

Dropdown.Toggle = DropdownToggle;

export default Dropdown;
```

An alternative approach which avoids this pattern is by exporting each component separately instead of assigning them as properties to the main component,

```js:Dropdown.js
function Dropdown({ children }) {
  return (
    <div>{children}</div>
  );
}

export function DropdownToggle({ children }) {
  return (
    <button>{children}</button>
  );
}

export default Dropdown;
```

If we use this alternate method, then we'd have to import them individually instead of importing just one big component,

```jsx
import Dropdown, { DropdownToggle } from 'library/Dropdown'
```

The advantage of this method is,

- optimizations like tree shaking will work.
- compatible with any react frameworks like Next js.
- more readable.

## Context

The main way to pass the data from one component to another is through props. This is not ideal approach if we need to pass it through multiple components or
to a far away component. This can also mean the data gets passed along through components which don't even need it. Over time, it becomes to hard to maintain
all the components.

Context helps with this problem by exposing the state or data to all the children components, which can be the whole application, and it can be accessed only by importing it.
Its really a JS object, that can store values. The `Provider` component that helps us broadcast or distribute the data stored in the context.

#### Syntax

1. First we create the context and add a `Provider` property to make the data available to whatever imports it.

```js:App.js
import React from 'react';
import RealApp from './RealApp';

export const ThemeContext = React.createContext();

const App = () => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = React.useState('light');

  return (
    // if you need to pass only 1 value - <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{theme, setTheme}}>
      <RealApp />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

> From React 19, the context object itself acts as a provider. So, it can be omitted. But both work nonetheless.
> The [use](https://react.dev/reference/react/use) hook can be used instead of `useContext`. This hook is used to pluck the data from Context or ,in some cases, a Promise.

```js:App.js
import React from 'react';
import RealApp from './RealApp';

export const ThemeContext = React.createContext();

const App = () => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = React.useState('light');

  return (
    // This is the modern approach
    <ThemeContext value={{theme, setTheme}}>
      <RealApp />
    </ThemeContext>
  )
}
```

2. Then we import the context and use it using the `useContext` hook. The useContext hook retrieves the data in the
   context, and plugs it into RealApp component, which is being broadcasted by the context provider built-in.

```js:RealApp.js
import React from 'react';
import {ThemeContext} from './App.js'

const RealApp = () => {
  const {theme, setTheme} = React.useContext(ThemeContext);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setTheme('dark')}>Change theme</button>
      <Dashboard theme={theme} />
    </>
  )
}
```

#### Refactors

It is better to create separate context providers based on the data being shared. For example, if we want to
make the `user` object available through context, then we should create a new context provider instead of creating a merged provider
for `theme` & `user`. This improves readability, performance in some situations.

It is also a good idea to create a new component solely for defining the context provider. This move de-clutters the
`App.js` if there is lot of code involved with a particular context provider.

If a [Pure component](./performance-optimizations#memo) is using a context, it will re-render if the context provider re-renders
without changing the value in the context. This defeats the purpose of the pure component, so the context provider should be
memoized, so it only re-renders if the context value changes:

```js:App.js
import React from 'react';
import RealApp from './RealApp';

export const ThemeContext = React.createContext();

const App = () => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = React.useState('light');

// memoized values shared through Context.
  const themeValues = React.useMemo(() => {
    return {theme, setTheme};
  }, [theme]);

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={themeValues}>
      <RealApp />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

## Modal

A modal is a window that pops up in front of the main content. It requires the user to interact with it before they can return to the main content.
It is a good idea to create a separate component for the modal, so that it can be reused in different parts of the application.

A Dialog is a modal that is used when we need some user input.
A tool tip is a modal that is used to show some information when the user hovers over an element.
A popup is a modal that is used to show some information without blocking other interactions.

Some of the non-exhaustive accessibility requirements when building a modal are:

- The modal should be able to be closed by clicking outside of it.
- The modal should be able to be closed by pressing the escape key.
- The modal should be able to be closed by clicking on a close button.
- The modal should be able to be closed by clicking on a cancel button.
- The modal should be able to be closed by clicking on a submit button.
- The focus should be trapped inside the modal when it is open.
- Being able to focus on the first focusable element in the modal when it is open, which could be the close button or the first input element.
- Focusing on the last focused element when the modal is closed.
- People using screen readers should be made aware that the modal is open by setting a title to the modal.

An example is taken from [joyofreact.com](https://joyofreact.com) course - [modal sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/still-sound-n4n2s5?workspaceId=ws_TjZrMChQgcYVTboVtKvEVn).

Another example of a modal built using <dialog /> tag is shown here in the MDN website which uses a CSS pseudo class to style it - [modal in MDN website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:modal).
