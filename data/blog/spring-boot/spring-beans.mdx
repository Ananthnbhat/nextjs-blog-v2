## Overview

Most of the concepts in this page is for bean defined using `@Bean` annotation, if not mentioned otherwise.

As explained [in this page](./spring-ioc-container) and [in this page](./spring-boot-essentials-annotations-1#component-vs-bean-annotation), Spring IoC container manages a beans based on the instructions given by the developer. Inside the container, each bean has a definition. Each definition contains:

- Implementation of the Class to which the bean belongs to.
- Instructions on how the bean should behave such as scope.
- Other bean definitions which the bean uses.
- Other miscellaneous configuration settings for the bean.

## Naming a bean

If you are creating a bean using `@Bean` annotation, each bean should have a unique name. If it requires more than one name, then they are called as aliases. The convention is to use camel cased names for the beans, such as `employeeService`.
Example:

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

	@Bean
	public MyBean myBean() {
		return new MyBeanImpl();
	}

	@Bean({"myOtherBean", "beanNameTwo"})
	public MyBean myOtherBeanWithDifferentName() {
		return new MyOtherBeanImpl();
	}

}
```

Things to note from above example,

- A method is marked as a bean.
- Beans are defines inside a Configuration class.
- Return type of both the beans is `XyzBean`.
- There are 2 beans defined which return different implementation although the return type is same (both implement same interface).
- The 2nd bean has 2 aliases, myOtherBean and beanNameTwo.

## Bean scopes

A scope can be defined for a bean, which can control how a bean is used while creating objects from it.

### Singleton (default scope)

```java
@Scope(BeanDefinition.SCOPE_SINGLETON)
```

When a bean is singleton scoped, only one instance of it is created. So, if the same bean is requested in multiple places, the same instance of the bean is returned.
In other words, if the bean value is modified in one place, the value gets modified in all other places where the bean is being used. Single bean could cause problem in multithreading as same bean
instance could be accessed by multiple threads, causing `Race Condition` - so the beans should be immutable (use final).

### Prototype

```java
@Scope(BeanDefinition.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
```

This scope is opposite of singleton scope. So, every time a prototype bean is requested by the container (using the `getBean()` method) a new instance of the bean is created and returned.
The IoC container doesn't entirely manage the prototype scoped bean, it only initializes and configures it. So, its up to the client to clean up any expensive resources used for this bean. This can be accomplished by using `BeanPostProcessor` which holds reference to the bean. This processor can also be used for many other purposes when we want to customize how Spring manages a bean.

This scope is rarely used and its used if the bean frequently changes its state of data resulting in `Race Condition`.

### Request (web aware only)

The request scoped bean is created specific to a HTTP request. So, a new instance of bean gets created and returned by the IoC container whenever the request is observed. Once the request is completed, the bean is discarded.

```java
@RequestScope
@Component
public class LoginAction {
	// ...
}
```

### Session (web aware only)

The session scoped bean is specific to a HTTP session. For every HTTP session, a new bean is returned by the ApplicationContext and discarded once the session completes.

```java
@SessionScope
@Component
public class UserPreferences {
	// ...
}
```

### Application (web aware only)

The application scoped bean is specific to a web application, rather, more specific to a `ServletContext`. This scope differs from Singleton scope like this - An application can have multiple ServletContexts whereas only one ApplicationContext. An application scoped bean is shared with multiple ServletContexts

```java
@ApplicationScope
@Component
public class AppPreferences {
	// ...
}
```

### WebSocket (web aware only)

The WebSocket scoped bean is specific to a WebSocket session. This is similar to Singleton bean but scoped to a WebSocket session.

Custom scopes can be created as explained [here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/factory-scopes.html#beans-factory-scopes-custom).

> Further exercise: applications of these bean scopes in various scenarios

## Lazy initialized beans

By default, all the singleton beans are instantiated at the startup of the application. If this is not desirable, beans can be initiated lazily, meaning, beans get instantiated only when requested.

`@Lazy` annotation can be written on top of the `@Configuration` class, to make all the beans inside this class loaded lazily.

If we want to lazy load a class with stereotype annotation such as `@Component` and use it by Autowiring, it needs to be done this way.

1. Define the Component annotated class with `@Lazy` annotation

```java
@Lazy
@Component
public class ClassA {
    // ...
}
```

2. Autowire with `@Lazy` annotation

```java
public class ClassBUsesClassA {

    @Lazy
    @Autowire
    private ClassA classA;
    // ...
}
```

## Customizing a bean

### Lifecycle callbacks

There are 2 spring boot annotations that can,

1. execute some logic right after a bean is initialized by the ApplicationContext and properties have been set - `@PostConstruct`
2. execute logic just before the bean gets discarded by ApplicationContext - `@PreDestroy`

More about these 2 annotations explained [here](./spring-boot-essentials-annotations-1#postconstruct-vs-predestroy-annotation).

## Appendix

**Race condition** - 2 or more threads try to access/modify same resource(s) leading to discrepancies in the final result of the modification.
