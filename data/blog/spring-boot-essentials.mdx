## Dependency injection: Field vs Constructor

Option A: Constructor injection (preferred):

```java:FileUpload.java
@Component
public class FileUpload {
    private final StorageService storageService;

    @Autowired
    public FileUploadController(StorageService storageService) {
        this.storageService = storageService;
    }
}
```

Option B: Field injection:

```java:FileUpload.java
@Component
public class FileUpload {
    @Autowired private StorageService storageService;
}
```

Although option A has more code, it provides better readability and also forces anyone using the `FileUpload` to define StorageService without fail. The option B can lead to null pointer exception as
FileUpload can be used without defining storageService as below:

```java
FileUpload fileUpload = new FileUpload();
```

## RestController vs Controller annotations

Both are synonymous to `@Component` but with the meaning that both are used as controllers that act as request receivers for the server.
The RestController is a specialized version of Controller annotation in which it combines Controller & ResponseBody annotations as below:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("files")
public class SomeController {

  @GetMapping
  public String returnFileName(@PathVariable int id) {
    return "a file name";
  }
}
```

```java
@Controller
@RequestMapping("files")
public class SomeController {

  @GetMapping
  public @ResponseBody String returnFileName(@PathVariable int id) {
    return "a file name";
  }
}
```

## ConfigurationProperties vs Configuration annotations

`@Configuration` is a annotation used on a class. The class should have methods annotated with `@Bean` annotation.
The `@Bean` annotation means that the object returned by the method is completely handled by Spring IoC container (instantiation, configuration, initialization). `@Bean` annotated methods are most often used with `@Configuration` annotated classes. A `@Bean` is [singleton scoped](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/beans/factory-scopes.html) by default.
The `@Configuration` annotated class indicates its purpose -> to house `@Bean` definitions.

`@ConfigurationProperties` is used on a class to indicate that the class is managed by Spring IoC container. It is also tells spring to bring the values of the defined objects from external source (ex. application.properties)

### `@Configuration` example:

```java:AppConfig.java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

	@Bean
	public BeanOne beanOne() {
		return new BeanOne(beanTwo());
	}

	@Bean
	public BeanTwo beanTwo() {
		return new BeanTwo();
	}
}

```

### `@ConfigurationProperties` example:

```java:StorageProperties.java
@ConfigurationProperties("storage")
public class StorageProperties {
    private String location = "upload-dir";

    public String getLocation() {
        return location;
    }

    public void setLocation(String location) {
        this.location = location;
    }
}
```

Requires enabling in the main method:

```java:MainApp.java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableConfigurationProperties(StorageProperties.class)
public class MainApp {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MainApp.class, args);
    }
}
```

Then externally define the value:

```properties:application.properties
storage.location=D://myDir
```
