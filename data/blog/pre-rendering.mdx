## What is pre-rendering?

Pre-rendering is generation of the HTML of a page, not by the browser but by a server which is managed by Next js. This takes away the rendering
work frm the browser, saving memory and decreasing page load time. Once the pre-rendering is completed and bare minimum is shown to the user,
the "hydration" happens

## What is hydration?

Adding interactivity (JavaScript) to a generated HTML page.

So, in Next js, a bare minimum HTML page is shown to the user (pre-rendering) and then it becomes interactive. Whereas in normal React applications,
nothing is shown to the user initially, rendering & hydration happens in the browser and then page is shown.

Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
