## CSS modules

There are different ways in which a React js page can be styled using CSS. One of them is CSS modules. The disadvantage of using normal CSS is that, once a style is defined, it can be used globally by any component. CSS modules overcomes this issue by keeping the style scope to local by default.

> This means that the defined styles can only be used by importing the module.css file into the component.

If there is file called `layout.js`, it's CSS should be defined in a file called `layout.module.css`. Then this file should be imported inside the layout.js file as shown below -

```jsx
...
import styles from './layout.module.css'
...

const Layout = () => {
    return (
        <div className={styles.container}>
        ...
        </div>
    )
}
...

```

## Styled components

This is a css-in-js method of styling highly used in React components, where styling for particular components are defined. It has advantages like,

- code splitting - suppose a component is being rendered, load/inject css for that component only.
- easy maintenance - styling stays in the component being styled - easy to find & manage
- auto vendor prefix - automatically adds the vendor prefixes to the css!.

```jsx
//styled component 1
const Title = styled.h2`
  font-size: 1.5em;
  text-align: center;
  color: #bf4774;
`
//styled component 2
const Wrapper = styled.div`
  padding: 4em;
  background: papayawhip;
`
render(
  <Wrapper>
    <Title>Styled components!</Title>
  </Wrapper>
)
```

It is also possible to pass props to the styled component like so,

```javascript
const Button = styled.button<{ $secondary?: boolean; }>`
  /* Adapt the colors based on the secondary prop */
  color: ${props => props.$secondary ? "white" : "#BF4F74"};

  font-size: 1.5em;
  margin: 1.5em;
`;

render(
  <div>
    <Button>Primary button</Button>
    <Button $secondary>Secondary button</Button>
  </div>
);
```
